          <div class="body-text">Ontario provides funding to Ontario Public libraries every year. What determines how much funding a library will need? What would the funding requirements of a newly built library be? How much funding will libraries need next year?</div>
          <div class="body-text">The Ontario Library Survey data was analysed with the intention of determining the answers to these questions.  After analysis it was found that population was the feature correlated with funding which could be used help answer the questions being asked. If we generate a model based on population which determines funding, then we would only need to know the population of the location where the new library was being built to determine it’s funding needs. We would only need to look at the forecast for Ontario’s population next year to know how much funding the libraries would need.</div>
          <div class="body-text">However simple linear regression returns a poor R2 when preformed on these two features. What next? Tree regression is the answer the model preformed much better and returned a R2 of 0.87.</div>
	  <div class="body-text">To demonstrate the model funding was predicted a library in a city with a population of 100,000. The model predicts the funding given to a city with that population would be 166,475 and from the MAE we can expect that the actual value will be within plus or minus 17,281 of the predicted value.</div>
